    "content": "The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) inspection staff regarding the use of digital signatures for the issuance of Agency specific domestic inspection documents. Digital signatures should be used by inspection staff as an alternative to wet signatures. Unless otherwise specified, digital signatures are not acceptable for export certificates."

    "content": "Digitally signed PDF forms must remain in their original electronic format, not a scanned version, and saved using Acrobat Reader DC, in order to be accepted. If the form you wish to sign is not set up for digital signatures, see Print to PDF to enable digital signature for a workaround. Documents filled out or signed using Foxit Phantom PDF will not apply digital signatures in Acrobat Reader DC. Not all employees have access to Foxit Phantom PDF, therefore you must use Acrobat Reader DC to complete and sign forms requiring more than one digital signature."

    "content": "PDF files are compact, secure and can be read on any device while maintaining the same content and layout. In addition, PDF supports digital signatures which are more important than ever in the context of a paperless workplace. Some of the forms available in the forms catalogue on Merlin do not currently permit digital signatures . To work around this, fill in all the fields, except the signature, then convert the form to PDF to enable digital signatures."

    "title": "Notice to International Trading Partners: Progress Towards Electronic Certification",
    "content": "The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is phasing in the launch of electronic export certificates across food, animal and plant commodities. Automation of the export processes and certificates will be rolled out incrementally starting this year. This will allow industry time to adjust to the new way of doing business with the CFIA and to minimize any disruption to trade as existing versions of export certificates are phased out. As the CFIA transitions to electronic certification through My CFIA, certificates may continue to be signed with ink or a new electronic signature and new features such as digital images and certificate numbering will be added. Current and revised versions of the certificates (and shipping marks) will remain in circulation during the transition period. The CFIA will also maintain the secure paper requirements through the transition period to government to government transmission, where removing secure paper requirements can be considered."
