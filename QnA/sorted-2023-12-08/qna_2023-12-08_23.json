    "text_content": " Therefore, the differences were not considered to be biologically meaningful and the results support a conclusion of phenotypic and agronomic equivalence to currently grown corn varieties\n Monsanto Canada Inc\n provided information on the dormancy and germination of corn event MON 87419 seed under seven different temperature regimes\n Seed germination characteristics were evaluated, including percent germinated seed (normal and/or abnormal), percent hard seed, percent dead seed and percent firm swollen seed\n A corn event MON 87419 hybrid was compared to an unmodified control corn hybrid with a similar genetic background\n Eight reference corn hybrids were included to provide a range of comparative values for each germination characteristic\n Seed lots were produced at three sites in the US\n Statistically significant differences were observed between the corn event MON 87419 hybrid and the unmodified control corn hybrid for three temperature regimes for the percent of germinated seed\n However the values for the corn event MON 87419 hybrid were only slightly higher than that of the unmodified control corn hybrid, and for two of the three temperature regimes were within the range of values established for the reference corn hybrids\n Therefore these instances of statistically significant differences are not considered biologically meaningful\n Moreover, the lack of hard seed indicated that corn event MON 87419 does not possess seed dormancy\n Therefore, the introduction of the novel traits did not impact the germination of the corn seed and did not confer dormancy to the corn seed\n The response of the corn event MON 87419 hybrid to abiotic stressors was observed at nine sites in 2013 and three sites in 2014\n The stressors included cold, drought, flooding, hail, heat, mineral toxicity, nutrient deficiency, soil compaction and wind\n No trend in increased or decreased susceptibility to these abiotic stressors was observed in the corn event MON 87419 hybrid compared to the unmodified control corn hybrid",
    "question": "Is there a potential for corn event MON 87419 to become a weed of agriculture?",
    "answer": "The differences observed between the corn event MON 87419 hybrid and the unmodified control corn hybrid were not considered biologically meaningful. The introduction of the novel traits did not impact the germination of the corn seed and did not confer dormancy to the corn seed. Therefore, there is no potential for corn event MON 87419 to become a weed of agriculture."
