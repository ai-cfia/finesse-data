    "text_content": "1.4.1 Referring food safety incidents to the Office of Food Safety and Recall Notifying the area/regional recall coordinator who in turn refers food safety incidents to the OFSR at the appropriate time ensures an efficient and consistent CFIA response to potential risks of injury to human health associated with food in distribution. It enables: engagement of appropriate team members (for example, the lead investigator, supervisor, area/regional recall coordinator, OFSR) at the right time communication of appropriate information in a timely manner within the food safety investigation team with CFIA's senior management, other CFIA branches and external partners (for example, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture and the International Food Safety Authorities NetworkFootnote 6) a more effective use of operational resources by limiting delays and redundancies. There are situations where an incident is brought to the attention of the OFSR first, either by CFIA senior management, other CFIA branches, or external partners (such as the Public Health Agency of Canada, foreign governments or international organizations). In such cases, the OFSR engages the inspectorate, without delay, by communicating the information to the area/regional recall coordinator. For the process for referring food safety incidents, including early referrals, to the Office of Food Safety and Recall, please follow Appendix 2, Procedure 11: Referring food safety incidents to the Office of Food Safety and Recall.",
