    "text_content": "II\n Background Information BASF Canada has developed a lentil line tolerant to imidazolinone herbicides\n This L\n culinaris line, designated line RH44, exhibited no significant injury when treated with imidazolinone herbicides at normal field application rates\n This will allow the use of imidazolinones in post-emergence on lentil crops, thus providing an alternative means of weed control in lentil production\n The development of line RH44 was accomplished using chemically induced seed mutagenesis\n The herbicide tolerance trait is conferred by a single point mutation modification of the acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) gene such that this enzyme, the target of imidazolinone herbicides, is no longer affected by imidazolinones\n Line RH44 has been field tested in Canada from 1999 to 2002 under confined conditions in the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan\n BASF Canada has provided data on the identity of line RH44, a detailed description of the modification method and breeding history, information on the modified gene, the resulting protein and its mode of action and the stability of trait expression\n References to scientific publications were also included\n Agronomic characteristics such as grain yield, days to maturity, plant height, and disease susceptibilities were compared with those of unmodified L\n culinaris counterparts\n Nutritional components of line RH44 such as proximates, amino acids and fatty acids were compared with unmodified lentil counterparts\n Levels of anti-nutritional factors were also compared between the line RH44 and the unmodified counterparts",
    "question": "What lentil line has BASF Canada developed?",
    "answer": "BASF Canada has developed a lentil line tolerant to imidazolinone herbicides called line RH44."
