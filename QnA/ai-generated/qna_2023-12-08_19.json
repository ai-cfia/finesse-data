    "text_content": "5.5.6.3 Inspections of fishing vessels Regulation (EC) No. 854/2004 (Annex III, Chapter 1) establishes the authority for EU Member States to inspect fishing vessels at regular intervals. It was replaced by Regulation (EC) 2017/625 (Article 18). This is to make sure that they are meeting the requirements for: hygiene temperature sanitation fish handling any other prescribed license requirements Since HACCP isn't required for entities involved in primary production, Good Manufacturing Practices and GHPs are considered to be appropriate. Inspections of fishing vessels are required every 4 years. Spanish inspectors travel to the third-country port to deliver the inspections for: factory fishing vessels that rarely dock Spanish-flagged ships that dock in third-country ports In the case of vessels docked in another EU Member State, Spain can ask that other Member State to deliver the inspection on their behalf. In 2020, paper reviews were conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions. The PNCOCA has requirements for monitoring primary production hygiene in extractive fisheries, including fishing vessels. The goal of oversight inspection for 5% of fishing vessels, to verify GHPs and record keeping, was met in 2020. The decision on which vessels are prioritized is based on risk criteria including: vessel size species fished third-party reporting previous inspection results Conclusion Spain's system of official controls is subject to a comprehensive oversight framework. This includes the inspections of fishing vessels, the oversight of the controls implemented by FBOs, and the verification of the overall effectiveness of the controls. Some challenges were noted in meeting planned HACCP audit frequencies and in generating reliable statistics on the overall delivery of the program as well as industry NC.",
