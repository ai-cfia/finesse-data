    "text_content": "Does Canada's cold climate limit the pest's spread? No. The BSLB can withstand Canada's cold climate, although it can take up to two years or more to complete its lifecycle here. In warmer climates, it can complete its life cycle in one season or less.\nWhat does the brown spruce longhorn beetle look like? The adult beetle is 0.8 to 1.8 cm long with a slightly flattened body that is dark tan, brown or reddish brown with a lighter coloured band visible on some specimens across the shoulder part of the wing covers. The pest's head and thorax are dark brown to black and its legs are brown. The BSLB has compound eyes completely divided into two parts and red-brown antennae about one third to one half its body length.\nIs it easy to find adult brown spruce longhorn beetles? No. Adult beetles are difficult to find because of their appearance and behaviour. Their brown bark like colour is a good natural camouflage. They are more active at dusk, but during the daytime they like to hide under bark scales. However, advances in science have led to better detection methods, such as pheromone based traps that simulate the hormones the insects use to attract mates.\nDoes the brown spruce longhorn beetle prefer specific types of spruce trees? In Nova Scotia, the BSLB is known to attack healthy, dying and recently fallen spruce trees (e.g. windfall). This pest has the potential to spread throughout all spruce tree populations including red, white, and black spruce. Other environmental conditions, including drought and the presence of other insect species, may increase a tree's susceptibility to BSLB attack. Although any spruce tree 10 centimetres or more in diameter may be attacked, the beetle tends to prefer mature spruce trees (in excess of 30 cm in diameter at breast height). Spruce trees are the only known hosts of BSLB in North America.",
