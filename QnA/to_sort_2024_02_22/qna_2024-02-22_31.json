    "text_content": "Cericola Farms Inc. fined $400,000.00 for violating the Food and Drugs Act February 16, 2018, Ottawa: On February 12, 2018, at the Ontario Court of Justice in Barrie, Ontario, Cericola Farms Inc. of Bradford, Ontario, pled guilty to two counts of violating section 5 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act. The company was ordered to pay total fines of $400,000.00 and sentenced to one year of probation. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) investigation determined that Cericola's tracking records were inconsistent which made tracing activities difficult. According to CFIA's analysis, during a nine-month period, approximately 286,000 kg of poultry was sold in a manner likely to create an erroneous impression of its character and nature, contrary to 5 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act. Cericola was unable to demonstrate otherwise. Section 5 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act states that no person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any food in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety. There is no food recall associated with this prosecution. Cericola Farms Inc. is a federally registered poultry processing establishment and is certified to process specialty poultry products including organic, antibiotic-free and animal by product free, and halal chicken products. The CFIA is responsible for the administration and enforcement of federal legislation, acts and regulations, including the Food and Drugs Act. The CFIA is dedicated to safeguarding food, animal, and plant health, which enhances the health and well-being of Canada's people, environment, and economy.
