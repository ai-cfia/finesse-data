    "question": "What are the relative firmness levels of different types of cheese?",
    "answer": "The relative firmness of different types of cheese is categorized as follows:\n\n1. Fresh Soft Cheese and fromage à pâte fraîche or fromage frais: 80% or more moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis.\n2. Soft Cheese and fromage à pâte molle: More than 67% but less than 80% moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis.\n3. Semi-soft Cheese and fromage à pâte demi-molle or fromage demi-mou: More than 62% but not more than 67% moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis.\n4. Firm Cheese and fromage à pâte ferme: 50% or more but not more than 62% moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis.\n5. Hard Cheese and fromage à pâte dure: Less than 50% moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis.\n6. Hard Grating Cheese and fromage à pâte ferme à râper: 34% or less moisture content of cheese on a fat-free basis. This category refers to hard cheese that is intended for grating."
