    "text_content": "4.3.4.3 Case study support As explained previously in this report, from an analysis of the responses from a 2011 foodborne illness outbreak incident, compared to an earlier one in 2009 and to the 2008 listeriosis outbreak, it can be concluded that continual improvements in the intra- and inter-jurisdictional ability to manage and respond to foodborne illness outbreaks have occurred, based on descriptions provided by interviewees. With each incident, notable gains have been identified. Examples include: A clearer understanding of roles and responsibilities by partners (2011 incident); The speed with which partners were identified and brought into the response team (2009 incident); and The fostering and burgeoning of new and existing relationships amongst federal departments and agencies facing an unprecedented situation (Japan Disaster). Finally, it was indicated by many interviewees that the existence and continuous revision of key documentation, namely the FIORP, has been critical to these improvements. It has helped to delineate roles, responsibilities and expectations which has, in turn, improved emergency management response.",
