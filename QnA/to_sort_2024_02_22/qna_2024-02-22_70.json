All have a role protecting the health and well-being of horses from infectious diseases. Biosecurity in the horse industry is a shared responsibility between: horse owners and custodians of farms or facilities; organizers and their staff and volunteers of any event at which horses commingle including but not limited to auctions, competitions, gymkhanas, clinics, trail rides, and race tracks; everyone who handles horses including coaches, riders, drivers and grooms; service providers (for example: veterinarians, farriers, feed suppliers and transporters) accessing horse farms and facilities; horse associations, industry bodies, and government; and visitors to any horse facility. The guidance in this document is primarily for custodians, those individuals directly responsible for the care of horses or who have influence on those directly responsible. \"Closed herd\"?

However, all diseases risks have not been eliminated and the horses are still vulnerable to pathogens transmitted by biological and mechanical vectors such as: mosquitoes, flies, ticks, feed, people, and tack or equipment.",
