    "text_content": " Acceptable test substances would typically be medicating ingredients\n Non-medicated tracers might also be acceptable provided that the baseline levels in both test batches could be established through analytical testing\n Level of Test Substance in Batch A The level of test substance in Batch A shall be sufficiently high enough to allow detection in Feed B at the carryover being established, e\ng\n, determining a 3% carryover requires addition of test substance in Batch A at 33 times the detection limit\n Sample results indicating not detected shall be interpreted as equal to the detection limit\n Ingredient Testing Where a medicating ingredient is used as the test substance, the facility may want to test unmedicated supplements or premixes used in the manufacture of this batch of feed to determine whether there is any baseline contamination of the batch with the test substance\n Where the test substance is a trace mineral, the facility shall determine the baseline level in at least the second batch of feed (Batch B)\n Sampling Procedure For each of Batch A and Batch B, ten spot samples representing the full batch shall be taken at equally spaced intervals at the end of the production line being tested and then combined into one composite sample for laboratory analysis\n Take spot samples by holding a small box, cup or scoop in the stream of feed and collecting 10 equally sized spot samples at the end of the production line being tested (for a total composite sample size of between 250 and 500 grams for dry feeds and between 500 and 1000 grams for Total Mixed Ration (TMR) mixes of feed)\n The entire sample for both Batch A and Batch B shall be submitted to the designated laboratory\n Feed Program, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), policy does not allow for introducing error by sample splitting\n Assessing Sample Results For Batch A, the sample results will be considered to represent the level of the selected test substance for that batch\n For Batch B, the sample results will be considered to represent the level of carryover for that individual sequence\n Sample results indicating Not Detected will be interpreted as equal to the detection limit",
    "question": "What are acceptable test substances for measurement of feed?",
    "answer": "Acceptable test substances for measurement of feed typically include medicating ingredients. Non-medicated tracers might also be acceptable, provided that the baseline levels in both test batches can be established through analytical testing."
