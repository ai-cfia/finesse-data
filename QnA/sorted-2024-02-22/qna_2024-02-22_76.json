    "text_content": "4.7.2 Complaints Legal Authorities Safe Food for Canadians Regulations(based on current suggested preliminary text) 59. (1) Every operator, and every licence holder authorized to import a food, must prepare, keep and maintain a document that sets out a procedure for receiving, investigating and responding to complaints received in relation to the food. (2) If a complaint is received, the operator or licence holder must implement the procedure and prepare, keep and maintain a document that sets out the complaint information, the results of the investigation and the actions taken based on those results for a period of three years from the day on which the actions are completed. Compliance Rationale Complaints are important indicators of possible deficiencies in preventive controls and in the preventive control plan, its implementation or the distribution system. Deficiencies in the way complaints are handled could result in the failure to identify and eliminate food safety risks and other regulatory issues. Records of complaints must be kept for three years after the complaint has been actioned to demonstrate that the complaint was properly managed and the system is being properly maintained and improved. Assessment Criteria A comprehensive plan is in place for handling and investigating complaints. The product complaint procedure includes, but may not be limited to: Instructions for the complaint handling and investigation process; identifying a competent person or persons responsible for receiving, evaluating, categorizing and investigating complaints; a means of categorizing complaints e.g. health and safety risks, labelling issues; the procedure for examining the complainants sample specimen, retail product or other product of the same code by appropriate personnel; instructions for immediately forwarding details of potentially serious complaints to appropriate personnel for action; a process for investigating safety and contamination complaints by trained technical personnel; and, the manner of ensuring that the investigation of a complaint is appropriate to the risk and known complaint trends. Product complaints are investigated based on the applicable complaints procedure to determine the root cause. If deemed necessary, corrective actions are taken for non-compliance, to address: the implicated food, and any changes to processes or procedures that are required to prevent recurrence Records pertaining to complaints, including the complaint information, results of the investigation and the actions taken based on those results, are maintained for a period of three years from the day on which the actions are completed.",
